<h3>
    LifeSpa Web Interface
</h3>
<p>
    At my Life Time internship, I had a full stack project where I made a Web Interface for LifeSpa business partners. 
    There were some members whose customerId became disassociated with their account, which prevented them
    from seeing their LifeSpa appointents.
    The interface allowed the business partners to re-sync members customerId with their LifeSpa account with the
     click of a button and the members could then see their appointments. 
</p>
<h3>
    Congratulatory Screen
</h3>
<p>
    As another project at the Life Time internship, I made an animated screen that represented the company reaching 1 million
    digital subscribers. This included a loading bar being completed, confetti, and a congratulatory message
</p>
<h3>
    Trivia Game
</h3>
<p>
    In a computer science class in high school, I developed a mobile trivia game using MIT App Inventor. The game consisted of 
    trivia questions that were asked and the user was given multiple choice answers. At the end of the game, the user's score is 
    displayed as well as the answers they got correct.
