<h3>
    LifeSpa Web Interface
</h3>
<div class="LifeTime1">
    <p>
        At my Life Time internship, I had a full stack project where I made a Web Interface for LifeSpa business partners. 
        There were some members whose customerId became disassociated with their account, which prevented them
        from seeing their LifeSpa appointents.
        The interface allowed the business partners to re-sync members customerId with their LifeSpa account with the
        click of a button and the members could then see their appointments.

<h3>
    Congratulatory Screen
</h3>
<div class="LifeTime2">
    <p>
        As another project at the Life Time internship, I made an animated screen that represented the company reaching 1 million
        digital subscribers. This included a loading bar being completed, confetti, and a congratulatory message

<h3>
    Trivia Game
</h3>
<div class="Trivia">
    <p>
        In a computer science class in high school, I developed a mobile trivia game using MIT App Inventor. The game consisted of 
        trivia questions that were asked and the user was given multiple choice answers. At the end of the game, the user's score is 
        displayed as well as the answers they got correct. <br>
